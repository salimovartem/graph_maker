Rugby player Ilona Maher has won fans and admirers with her sporting talent.

But it's her message of body positivity that's attracted millions of followers on social media.

The US-born athlete, 28, regularly jumps on TikTok and Instagram to talk about body positivity and being a high-profile woman in sport.

Since the Paris Olympics, she's become one of the biggest rugby players in the world, and there are hopes that her recent move to UK side Bristol Bears could boost the sport's profile.

Even though she only played for 20 minutes as a substitute, her debut match last weekend drew a record crowd for the team, which relocated the fixture to a bigger venue.

The star hung around after the game for more than 90 minutes to pose for pictures and talk to fans.
